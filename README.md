SdFatLib
========
This repo is a clone of Bill Greiman SdFatLib_20131225 archive which isn't on Github as far as I can tell.  This repository is here so that I have the source code from this great library available online for easy cloning and supporting older projects.

Bill has a lot of other great libraries and I've found the SdFat library to be especially useful.  Thanks Bill for great code.
